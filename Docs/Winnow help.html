    <h4>Overview</h4>
    Winnow is an image viewer designed to quickly view raw files and
    jpgs and "winnow" down to the "picks" that are copied to the users
    computer from the camera storage medium.&nbsp; It also serves as a
    general image viewer and can launch other programs to edit images
    and it has a simple slideshow feature.<br>
    <h4>Quick tips</h4>
    Winnow is can be highly customized which might leave parts
    "stranded" on secondary monitors that are missing in action.&nbsp;
    Use the shortcut ⇧⌘W (or in the menu Window &gt; Workspace &gt;
    Default workspace) to reset to the default workspace.<br>

    <ol>
      <li>The folder panel.&nbsp; Panels (or docks) can be resized,
        moved to the top, left, right or bottom of the man window, or
        floated as a separate window.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The fav panel is used to bookmark your favourite folders for
        quick access.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The metadata panel displays information about the selected
        image.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The thumbs panel shows small thumbnails for all the images in
        the folder.&nbsp; If "Include subfolders" has been selected then
        all subfolder images will also be displayed.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The loupe view, where the image is displayed.&nbsp; Clicking
        on the image will zoom to 100% centered on the mouse click
        location.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The shooting information can be toggled via the shortcut "I".<br>
      </li>
      <li>The thumbs up icon shows this image has been picked.&nbsp; The
        list of images can be filtered to only show picks and only the
        picks are copied when "Ingest / Copy" is chosen.<br>
      </li>
      <li>This image is the current selected (white border) and has also
        been picked (green border).<br>
      </li>
      <li>This is the image cache status display.&nbsp; The entire bar
        represents all the images in the thumb list.&nbsp; The green
        part shows the images that have been cached and the tiny red bar
        shows where the current selection is situated.&nbsp; Cached
        images display much faster.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The cache status buttons (metadata, thumbs and full size
        images respectively) turn green when caching is
        active.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
