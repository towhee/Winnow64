<h3 style="color: white">Overview</h3>

<p>This tool automates the process of creating a folder in a specific
folder structure where the images will be copied. The folder structure comprises of a
<span style="background-color: blue">root</span>, a
<span style="background-color: green">template path</span> and a
<span style="background-color:purple">description</span>.
The files can also be renamed as they are copied.</p>

<h3 style="color: white">Creating a path to the destination folder</h3>

<p>Windows example:</p>
   <p style="margin-left:25px">
   <span style="background-color: blue">e:\</span>
   <span style="background-color: green">2018\2018-02\2018-02-23</span>
   <span style="background-color: purple">_Spring in Paris</span></p>

<p>Mac example:</p>
<p style="margin-left:25px">
<span style="background-color: blue">/users/pictures/</span>
<span style="background-color: green">Feb/23</span>
<span style="background-color: purple"> Paris<span></p>

<p><span style="background-color: blue">Root:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is the base location where your images are stored.  The root is entered in the
“Ingest Picks” dialog.</p>

<p><span style="background-color: green">Template path:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The path from the root to the destination folder that can be defined by metadata from
an image.  It is based on a template in “Edit Template(s)” accessed from the
“Ingest Picks” dialog.  The template for the windows example is {YYYY}/{YYYY}-{MM}-{DD}
and the mac example is {MMM}/{DD}.  The templates are based on tokens inside curly
brackets {}.
</p>

<p><span style="background-color: purple">Description:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
An optional description that is appended to the template path. It is entered in the
“Ingest Picks” dialog.</p>

<h3 style="color: white">Tokens</h3>

<p>Tokens are place holders and the values for the tokens are inserted from the metadata
in the images. Tokens are surrounded with curly brackets like this: {YYYY}.  In this case
the year is found in the image metadata and formatted as 2019.  If the token {YY} was
chosen then the result would be formatted as 19 if the year was 2019.  Tokens are
listed in the "Token editor", which is accessed from the "Ingest dialog".  Some other
examples of tokens include: {TITLE} {ORIGINAL FILENAME} {HOUR} {SECOND} {CREATOR} etc.</p>

<h3 style="color: white">Templates</h3>

<p>A template is a structure used to build a file path or a file name.  You create
templates using tokens and text in the "Template Editor". For example, to build the
folder structure</p>

<p style="margin-left:25px">Weddings/2019/Hill wedding/</p>

<p>we would build the template</p>

<p style="margin-left:25px">Weddings{2019}/{TITLE}/</p>

<p>assuming we had put the description "Hill wedding" in the Title metadata for the images.</p>

<h3 style="color: white">File names</h3>

<p>You can also create new file names using templates and tokens.  For example, if you
want file names in the format 2019-09-18_0187.NEF you would build the template</p>

<p style="margin-left:25px">{YYYY}-{MM}-{DD}_{XXXX}</p>

<p>The .NEF will automatically be appended.</p>

<h3 style="color: white">Slashes and back slashes</h3>

<p>Do not use “/” or “\” in the template name.  The template name is used as a key to save
the templates between sessions.  Slashes do terrible things to the windows registry.</p>

<p>In the template itself, Windows uses the “\” in file paths while MacOS and Linux use
“/”.  Since the “\” is also used for escape sequences I suggest you use the “/”.  Winnow
will automatically convert this to a “\” when creating the path to the destination folder
in windows. </p>

<p>For example, if the image was taken on Feb 23, 2018:</p>

<p style="margin-left:25px">Template = {YYYY}/{YYYY}-{MM}-{DD} will become
“2018\2018-02\2018-02-23” in windows.</p>
