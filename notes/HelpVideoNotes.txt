EMBELLISH INTRODUCTION
   - Welcome to Winnow and an introduction to the embellish module
   - Embellish allows you to add borders, text and graphics to your images.
   - Show some examples
   - Embellish has it's own panel
   - Templates are like recipes, holding all the information for a specific set of embellish 
     instructions
   - Export supplies the information req'd to create new images with all embellishments
   - A style is a group of one or more effects.
   - Effects include shadow, emboss, stoke, brightness, highlight, blur and sharpness.
   - General defines the final dimensions of the outer border, the direction of the light for 
     shadows, and the style assigned to the image.
   - Show borders, textx and graphics
   - Show Expand all, collapse all, solo and expand recursively
   - The embellish menu:
     - Export creates new files for the images that are selected or picked with the embellishments
     - Tiles are tiny images that are repeated tile-like to provide a pattern or texture to borders
     - Winnets are small, stand-alone programs that work like droplets in Photoshop, that allow 
       you to automatically embellish images exported from another program such as Lightroom.
