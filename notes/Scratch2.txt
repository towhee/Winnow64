to do
- make sure selection is sorted by capture time
- FS cleared between runs
- manage abort in MW::generateFocusStack
- flags (incl useDepthMap in runFusion)
- are focusSlices CV_32F if recover from disk?

PMaxStream
    Merge: PMax
    Merge: Weighted

PMaxStreamWeighted (WeightedPower, WeightedSigma0)
Depth-biased erosion
Edge-adaptive sigma

Steps:
1.  Stream PMax Fusion. (Done)
2.  Add mergeMode Weighted (WeightedPower, WeightedSigma0). (Done)
3.  Add Depth-biased erosion.  (Is this done?)
4.  Add Edge-adaptive sigma.  (To do)
