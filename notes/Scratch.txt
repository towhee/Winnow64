Qt, c++.

I have a QListView IconView, set to QListView::IconMode.  In each item I show a thumbnail
of an image.  I set a delegate:
    setItemDelegate(iconViewDelegate);

I also show various symbols in iconViewDelegate in public QRect such as:
QRect missingThumb.
QRect lock.
QRect rating
QRect combineRawJpg.
QRect cache.

IconViewDelegate::paint row = 0 CombineRawJpg = QRect(119,119 7x7)
IconViewDelegate::paint row = 1 CombineRawJpg = QRect(256,119 7x7)
IconViewDelegate::paint row = 2 CombineRawJpg = QRect(393,119 7x7)
IconViewDelegate::paint row = 3 CombineRawJpg = QRect(530,119 7x7)
IconViewDelegate::paint row = 4 CombineRawJpg = QRect(667,119 7x7)
IconViewDelegate::paint row = 5 CombineRawJpg = QRect(804,119 7x7)
IconViewDelegate::paint row = 6 CombineRawJpg = QRect(941,119 7x7)

When I mouse over each of the symbol QRects I want to show an explanatory tooltip.
