Here is a code snippet that shows how to extract the
first video frame from a QVideoWidget to a QPixmap in C++
using Qt 6:

QVideoFrame frame = videoWidget->videoSurface()->currentFrame();
if (!frame.isValid()) {
    return;
}
QImage image = frame.image();
QPixmap pixmap = QPixmap::fromImage(image);

This code snippet extracts the current video frame from a
QVideoWidget and converts it to a QPixmap. You can use this
code snippet to extract the first video frame by calling it
once.

QT 5 - NOT QT 6
